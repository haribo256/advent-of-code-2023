# Advent-of-Code 2023

This is my take on the Advent of Code challenge for 2023 (https://adventofcode.com/2023)

The challenge can be completed in any language, however, I am completing it in Rust.

Their is a challenge for each day in December leading upto Christmas. 

Each day is split into two puzzles, the first puzzle is used to unlock the second.

# Structure

Each day is its own binary crate inside a Cargo workspace. Each crate is split into two binaries.
